200. Number of Islands
https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/

Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.

An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

Example 1:

Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1

Example 2:

Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3

Constraints:

m == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 300
grid[i][j] is '0' or '1'.

// The runtime complexity of the numIslands function is O(MN), where M is the number of rows in the grid and N is the number of columns in the grid.
const numIslands = function (grid) {
  if (!grid || grid.length === 0) {
    return 0
  }

  const dfs = (i, j) => {
    if (
      i < 0 ||
      i >= grid.length ||
      j < 0 ||
      j >= grid[0].length ||
      grid[i][j] === '0'
    ) {
      return
    }
    grid[i][j] = '0'
    dfs(i - 1, j)
    dfs(i + 1, j)
    dfs(i, j - 1)
    dfs(i, j + 1)
  }

  let count = 0
  for (let i = 0; i < grid.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < grid[0].length; j++) {
      if (grid[i][j] === '1') {
        count++
        dfs(i, j)
      }
    }
  }

  return count
}

const grid = [
  ['1', '1', '1', '1', '0'],
  ['1', '1', '0', '1', '0'],
  ['1', '1', '0', '0', '0'],
  ['0', '0', '0', '0', '0'],
]
console.log('numIslands(grid): ', numIslands(grid)) // 1

const grid2 = [
  ['1', '1', '0', '0', '0'],
  ['1', '1', '0', '0', '0'],
  ['0', '0', '1', '0', '0'],
  ['0', '0', '0', '1', '1'],
]
console.log('numIslands(grid2): ', numIslands(grid2)) // 3
