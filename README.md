# dsa

Modern JavaScript implementations for common data structures and algorithms. Several solutions are presented in multiple forms such as OOP, FP, declarative, iterative, recursive and so on.

LeetCode, Blind 75 and CodeWarz were all used to write the code in this repository. The major categories of Blind 75 are the path and emphasis of the code found in this repo. The main Blind 75 categories include Array, Binary, Dynamic Programming, Graph, Interval, Linked List, Matrix, String, and Tree.

Topics cover a wide range of data structures and algorithms (DSA) concepts that are frequently asked in coding interviews. By mastering the Blind 75 list, one can develop a strong foundation in DSA, and increase their chances of success in technical interviews.

DSA is a collection of fundamental computer science concepts that rely heavily on mathematical concepts. Some of the most important math concepts to learn for data structures and algorithms are:

Discrete Mathematics: Discrete mathematics is the study of mathematical structures that are discrete and countable, such as graphs, sets, and logic. Many concepts in data structures and algorithms, such as graph theory, combinatorics, and Boolean algebra, are based on discrete mathematics.

Calculus: Calculus is the study of continuous change and is important in understanding the time complexity of algorithms. Big-O notation, which is used to analyze the time complexity of algorithms, involves limits and derivatives from calculus.

Linear Algebra: Linear algebra is the study of vectors, matrices, and linear transformations. It is important in many applications of data structures and algorithms, such as machine learning and computer graphics.

Probability and Statistics: Probability and statistics are important in analyzing the performance of algorithms and in designing randomized algorithms. They are also used in machine learning and data analysis.

Number Theory: Number theory is the study of integers and their properties. It is important in cryptography, which is an important application of data structures and algorithms.

Combinatorics: Combinatorics is the study of counting and arrangements. It is important in understanding the complexity of algorithms that involve permutations, combinations, and arrangements.

Set Theory: Set theory is the study of sets and their properties. It is important in understanding the data structures that are used to store and manipulate sets, such as hash tables and binary search trees.

- Finding out if a path exists? DFS
- Finding the shortest path? BFS
- Cycle detection (linked list, array)? Floyds method
- Finding missing/repeated numbers? Gauss summation formula or Bitwise operations
- Hash maps: too general to say, lots of uses. ie., counting occurrences of characters in a string, keeping track of index where a character last appeared, etc.
- Heap: priority queue for certain graph algorithms, when you need quick access to highest/lowest element already processed, but may need to access more than one element.

Five major algorithms topics

- Ad hoc/ Implementation Problems
- Programming Paradigm(Greedy, backtracking, branch and bound, DP, Divide and Conquer, Brute force etc.)
- Graph Theory(directed, undirected, weighted, rooted(IN & OUT) and unrooted tree, DAG etc.)
- Math(Number theory, Computational Geometry, Combinatorics, Linear Algebra etc.)
- Others(String Processing, Bit Manipulation etc.)
